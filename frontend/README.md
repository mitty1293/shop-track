## Deployment

### üíª Local Development Environment (without Docker)

Follow these steps to run the development server directly on your local machine.

#### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

#### 2. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 3. Access the Application

The development server will be available at:

[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### üê≥ Local Development Environment (using Docker Compose)

Follow these steps to build and run a production-like container on your local machine.

#### 1. Build and Run the Container

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

#### 2. Access the Application

Once the container is up and running, open your browser and go to:

[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### üöÄ Production Environment (Example using Docker Compose & traefik)


1.  **Build and Push from Local Machine**
    1.  **Prepare Environment:** Create a `.env.production` file in the `frontend` directory.

    * **`VITE_API_BASE_URL`**:
        * The full base URL for the backend API. The frontend application will send all its API requests to this address.
        * Vite will automatically use this variable during the build process.
    * **`CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL`**:
        * The hostname of the container registry you are pushing to.
    * **`IMAGE_TAG`**:
        * The name and tag you want to assign to your built Docker image.

    2.  **Login to Registry:** Log in to the container registry.
        ```bash
        docker login <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>
        ```
    3.  **Build the Image:** Build the Docker image, tagging it with the registry's path.
        ```bash
        docker build -t <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/shoptrack-frontend:<IMAGE_TAG> .
        ```
    4.  **Push the Image:** Push the built image to the registry.
        ```bash
        docker push <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>/shoptrack-frontend:<IMAGE_TAG>
        ```
2.  **Run on Deployment Server**
    1.  **Prerequisite:** Before running the application, ensure the deployment server is authenticated with the container registry.  
        This is typically a one-time setup command performed during server provisioning.
        ```bash
        # (Example) Run this once when setting up the server
        docker login <CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL>
        ```
    2.  **Run:** Navigate to the `frontend` project directory (where `compose.traefik.yml` is located) and run the following command.  
        This will pull the image from the registry and start the application.
        ```bash
        docker compose -f compose.traefik.yml up -d
        ```
3.  **Access:** The application should typically be available at `https://shoptrack.${HOST_DOMAIN}`.

4.  **Stopping:** To stop the running services:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.traefik.yml down
    ```
